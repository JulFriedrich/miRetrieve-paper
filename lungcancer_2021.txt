TI  - Identification of novel transcription factor-microRNA-mRNA co-regulatory networks in 
      pulmonary large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.
PG  - 133

AB  - BACKGROUND: Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the lung is a rare 
      neuroendocrine neoplasm. Previous studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are 
      widely involved in tumor regulation through targeting critical genes. However, it is 
      unclear which miRNAs play vital roles in the pathogenesis of LCNEC, and how they 
      interact with transcription factors (TFs) to regulate cancer-related genes. METHODS: 
      To determine the novel TF-miRNA-target gene feed-forward loop (FFL) model of LCNEC, 
      we integrated multi-omics data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Transcriptional 
      Regulatory Relationships Unraveled by Sentence-Based Text Mining (TRRUST), 
      Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED), and The experimentally validated 
      microRNA-target interactions database (miRTarBase database). First, expression 
      profile datasets for mRNAs (GSE1037) and miRNAs (GSE19945) were downloaded from the 
      GEO database. Overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially 
      expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified through integrative analysis. The target 
      genes of the FFL were obtained from the miRTarBase database, and the Gene Ontology 
      (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment 
      analyses were performed on the target genes. Then, we screened for key miRNAs in the 
      FFL and performed gene regulatory network analysis based on key miRNAs. Finally, the 
      TF-miRNA-target gene FFLs were constructed by the hypergeometric test. RESULTS: A 
      total of 343 DEGs and 60 DEMs were identified in LCNEC tissues compared to normal 
      tissues, including 210 down-regulated and 133 up-regulated genes, and 29 
      down-regulated and 31 up-regulated miRNAs. Finally, the regulatory network of 
      TF-miRNA-target gene was established. The key regulatory network modules included 
      ETS1-miR195-CD36, TAOK1-miR7-1-3P-GRIA1, E2F3-miR195-CD36, and TEAD1-miR30A-CTHRC1. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We constructed the TF-miRNA-target gene regulatory network, which is 
      helpful for understanding the complex LCNEC regulatory mechanisms.

TI  - Human umbilical vein endothelial cells-derived microRNA-203-containing extracellular 
      vesicles alleviate non-small-cell lung cancer progression through modulating the 
      DTL/p21 axis.
LID - 10.1038/s41417-020-00292-3 [doi]
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, and is 
      characterized by extensive metastasis and poor prognosis. Extracellular vesicles 
      (EVs) derived from endothelial cells carrying microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) have 
      diagnostic and therapeutic potential for NSCLC. We herein investigate the potential 
      of EVs derived from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to transfer 
      miR-203 to affect the progression of NSCLC. miR-203 and p21 were poorly expressed 
      while DTL was highly expressed both in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. We employed 
      CCK-8 proliferation, colony formation, and Transwell migration and invasion assays 
      to evaluate the effects of miR-203 on NSCLC cell behaviors using loss- and 
      gain-function approaches. EVs were isolated from HUVECs and then co-cultured with 
      the A549 cells transfected with mimic-NC or miR-203 inhibitor. miR-203 targeted DTL 
      and downregulated its expression, subsequently leading to increased stability of p21 
      which is a tumor suppressor. EV-enriched miR-203 from HUVECs suppressed malignant 
      phenotypes of NSCLC cells and delayed tumor growth. In conclusion, miR-203 from 
      HUVEC-derived EVs exerts inhibitory effects on the progression of NSCLC by targeting 
      DTL and promoting p21 protein stability.

TI  - miR-31 displays subtype specificity in lung cancer.
LID - canres.2769.2020 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-2769 [doi]
AB  - miRNA rarely possess pan-oncogenic or tumor suppressive properties. Most miRNA 
      function under tissue-specific contexts, acting as either tumor suppressors in one 
      tissue, promoting oncogenesis in another, or having no apparent role in the 
      regulation of processes associated with the hallmarks of cancer. What has been less 
      clear is the role of miRNAs within cell types of the same tissue and the ability 
      within each cell type to contribute to oncogenesis. In this study, we characterize 
      the role of one such tissue-specific miRNA, miR-31, recently identified as the most 
      oncogenic miRNA in lung adenocarcinoma, across the histological spectrum of human 
      lung cancer. Compared to normal lung tissue, miR-31 was overexpressed in patient 
      lung adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell neuroendocrine 
      carcinoma, but not small cell carcinoma or carcinoids. miR-31 promoted tumor growth 
      in mice of xenografted human adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, 
      but not in large or small cell carcinoma lines. While miR-31 did not to promote 
      primary tumor growth of large and small cell carcinoma, it did promote spontaneous 
      metastasis. Mechanistically, miR-31 altered distinct cellular signaling programs 
      within each histological subtype, resulting in distinct phenotypic differences. This 
      is the first report distinguishing diverse functional roles for this microRNA across 
      the spectrum of lung cancers and suggests that miR-31 has broad clinical value in 
      human lung malignancy.

AB  - Exosomes carry functional molecules that can regulate cancer progression. 
      Understanding the function of exosomal markers may provide invaluable insights into 
      the mechanism of metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the 
      present study was to identify metastasis-associated microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) 
      expressed in plasma exosomes. A miRNA microarray and reverse 
      transcription-quantitative PCR were used to analyze the plasma exosome miRNA 
      expression profiles of patients with metastatic or non-metastatic HCC. Receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to evaluate 
      the predictive performance and prognostic efficacy of candidate miRNAs identified in 
      the Gene Expression Omnibus database (dataset accession no. GSE67140). 
      Bioinformatics analysis was used to examine the role of exosomal miRNAs in HCC 
      metastasis. A total of 32 miRNAs were differentially expressed in plasma exosomes of 
      patients with metastatic HCC compared with in those of patients with non-metastatic 
      HCC. Additionally, the expression levels of six miRNAs were consistent between 
      plasma exosome samples and matched tissue samples. ROC analysis demonstrated that 
      miR-18a, miR-27a and miR-20b could discriminate metastatic HCC from non-metastatic 
      HCC. Furthermore, the prognostic efficacy of the combination of three miRNAs 
      (miR-18a, miR-20b and miR-221) was superior to that of individual miRNAs. Survival 
      analysis demonstrated that high expression levels of the candidate miRNAs were 
      associated with poor prognosis. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the potential 
      target genes of these miRNAs were involved in biological processes, molecular 
      functions and cellular components that were associated with metastasis. The present 
      findings suggested that these exosomal miRNAs may serve important roles in HCC lung 
      metastasis and could represent a complementary clinical tool for the assessment of 
      HCC prognosis.

AB  - B-Myb is a critical transcription factor in regulating cell cycle. Dysregulated 
      expression of B-Myb promotes tumor formation and development. B-Myb is a 
      proto-oncogene ubiquitously expressed in proliferating cells, which maintains normal 
      cell cycle progression. It participates in cell apoptosis, tumorigenesis and aging. 
      In addition, B-Myb is overexpressed in several malignant tumors, including breast 
      cancer, lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, and is associated with tumor 
      development. B-Myb expression is also associated with the prognosis of patients with 
      malignant tumors. Both microRNAs and E2F family of transcription factors (E2Fs) 
      contribute to the function of B-Myb. The present review highlights the association 
      between B-Myb and malignant tumors, and offers a theoretical reference for the 
      diagnosis and treatment of malignant tumors.

LID - 615154
AB  - The Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) is a hallmark of cancer and is becoming a 
      promising target for diagnosis and therapy. Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) is the 
      first adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-generating glycolytic enzyme in the aerobic 
      glycolysis pathway and plays an important role in cancer development and 
      progression. However, how microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate PGK1-mediated aerobic 
      glycolysis remains unknown. Here, we show that miR-16-1-3p inhibits PGK1 expression 
      by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region. Through inhibition of PGK1, 
      miR-16-1-3p suppressed aerobic glycolysis by decreasing glucose uptake, lactate and 
      ATP production, and extracellular acidification rate, and increasing oxygen 
      consumption rate in breast cancer cells. Aerobic glycolysis regulated by the 
      miR-16-1-3p/PGK1 axis is critical for modulating breast cancer cell proliferation, 
      migration, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. In breast cancer patients, 
      miR-16-1-3p expression is negatively correlated with PGK1 expression and breast 
      cancer lung metastasis. Our findings provide clues regarding the role of miR-16-1-3p 
      as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer through PGK1 suppression. Targeting PGK1 
      through miR-16-1-3p could be a promising strategy for breast cancer therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exosomes are known to transmit microRNAs (miRNAs) to affect cancer 
      progression, while the role of M2 macrophages-derived exosomes (M2 exosomes) 
      conveying miR-501-3p in lung cancer (LC) remains unknown. We aim to explore the role 
      of exosomal miR-501-3p in LC development via targeting WD repeat domain 82 (WDR82). 
      METHODS: Lung cancer tissue and normal tissue specimens were collected, in which 
      tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) were measured by immunohistochemistry. M2 
      macrophages were induced and treated with altered miR-501-3p, and then the exosomes 
      were extracted and identified. MiR-501-3p and WDR82 expression in LC tissues and 
      cell liens was determined. The predictive role of miR-501-3p in prognosis of LC 
      patients was assessed, and the proliferation, colony formation ability, invasion, 
      migration and apoptosis of the LC cells were determined. Targeting relationship 
      between miR-501-3p and WDR82 was confirmed. RESULTS: TAM level was elevated in lung 
      cancer tissues. MiR-501-3p was upregulated while WDR82 was downregulated in LC 
      tissues and cell lines, and the M2 exosomes further upregulated miR-501-3p. M2 
      exosomes and exosomal miR-501-3p promoted LC cell growth. MiR-501-3p inhibition 
      reversed the effect of M2 exosomes on LC cells. WDR82 was confirmed as a target gene 
      of miR-501-3p. CONCLUSION: M2 macrophages-derived exosomal miR-501-3p promotes the 
      progression of LC via downregulating WDR82.

TI  - Role of microRNAs in Lung Carcinogenesis Induced by Asbestos.
LID - 97 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jpm11020097 [doi]
AB  - MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding endogenous RNAs 19-25 nucleotides long, 
      which play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene 
      expression by targeting mRNA targets with subsequent repression of translation. 
      MicroRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including cancer. 
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world. Lung cancer is 
      usually associated with tobacco smoking. However, about 25% of lung cancer cases 
      occur in people who have never smoked. According to the International Agency for 
      Research on Cancer, asbestos has been classified as one of the cancerogenic factors 
      for lung cancer. The mechanism of malignant transformation under the influence of 
      asbestos is associated with the genotoxic effect of reactive oxygen species, which 
      initiate the processes of DNA damage in the cell. However, epigenetic mechanisms 
      such as changes in the microRNA expression profile may also be implicated in the 
      pathogenesis of asbestos-induced lung cancer. Numerous studies have shown that 
      microRNAs can serve as a biomarker of the effects of various adverse environmental 
      factors on the human body. This review examines the role of microRNAs, the 
      expression profile of which changes upon exposure to asbestos, in key processes of 
      carcinogenesis, such as proliferation, cell survival, metastasis, neo-angiogenesis, 
      and immune response avoidance.

TI  - CircRNA_0000429 Regulates Development of NSCLC by Acting as a Sponge of miR-1197 to 
      Control MADD.
PG  - 861-870
LID - 10.2147/CMAR.S270790 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung 
      cancer. Circular RNA_0000429 (circ_0000429) is an identified circular RNA (circRNA) 
      that is correlated with cancer progression. However, the role of circ_0000429 in 
      NSCLC remains unknown. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the function of 
      circ_0000429 in NSCLC and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: The expression patterns 
      of circ_0000429 were determined using qRT-PCR in NSCLC samples and cell lines. The 
      subcellular distribution of circ_0000429 in NSCLC cells was analyzed by fluorescence 
      in situ hybridization (FISH). Cell proliferation was examined utilizing the CCK-8 
      assay. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated using the transwell assay. We used 
      the bioinformatics software TargetScan and miRanda to predict circRNA-miRNA and 
      miRNA-mRNA interactions. RESULTS: Our results showed that circ_0000429 expressions 
      were significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of 
      circ_0000429 significantly inhibited the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion 
      of NSCLC cells in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrated that circ_0000429 acted as a 
      sponge to absorb microRNA-1197 (miR-1197) and promoted MADD expression. CONCLUSION: 
      Collectively, our results demonstrated that circ_0000429 exhibited a carcinogenic 
      role by sponging miR-1197 and regulating CMADD expression in NSCLC. These findings 
      provided evidence for understanding the role of circ_0000429 in NSCLC tumorigenesis.

TI  - LncRNA PRNCR1 rs1456315 and CCAT2 rs6983267 Polymorphisms on 8q24 Associated with 
      Lung Cancer.
PG  - 255-266
LID - 10.2147/IJGM.S290997 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (lncRNA-SNPs) PCAT1 
      rs710886, PRNCR1 rs1456315 and CCAT2 rs6983267 on 8q24 region present 
      generalizability in the susceptibility to multiple cancers, however, the influence 
      of rs710886, rs1456315 and rs6983267 on lung cancer has not been assessed. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate associations between three lncRNA-SNPs and lung 
      cancer. METHODS: A case-control study was performed on 438 patients with lung cancer 
      and 456 healthy controls in the Han population from southern China. The collected 
      samples were genotyped by the TaqMan genotyping, and the association with clinical 
      characteristics, including age, gender, drinking status, smoking status, 
      pathological types and clinical stages were analyzed. And the SNP function 
      prediction was based on lncRNASNP2, RNAfold and GTEx. RESULTS: The rs1456315 T 
      allele increased the risk of lung cancer [OR=1.95, 95% CI (1.58-2.43), P=0.003] 
      compared to the rs1456315 C allele, and rs1456315 significantly increased the risk 
      of lung cancer in the dominant model [OR=1.86, 95% CI (1.16-3.00), P=0.002]. The 
      rs6983267 G allele, compared with the T allele, increased the risk of lung cancer 
      [OR=1.29, 95% CI (1.07-1.57), P=0.007], and rs6983267 was identified as a risk 
      factor for lung cancer [OR=1.28, 95% CI (1.06-1.55), P=0.003] in the additive model. 
      Both rs1456315 and rs6983267 demonstrated significance after adjusting for the 
      smoking status, drinking status and age. The structure prediction found rs6983267 
      and rs1456315 influence the secondary structure of its lncRNA. The results from 
      lncRNASNP2 indicated that rs6983267 and rs1456315 change gain/loss target of miRNAs. 
      CONCLUSION: PRNCR1 rs1456315 and CCAT2 rs6983267 on 8q24 region are significantly 
      associated with lung cancer in the Han population of southern China and alter the 
      potential biological function in bioinformatic analysis, and the results further 
      extended generalism of the susceptibility of cancer-associated lncRNA-SNPs to lung 
      cancer and underlying mechanism involved in lung cancer.
